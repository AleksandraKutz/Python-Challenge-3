# Python-Challenge-3
Module 3 Challenge
I created two folders for each Python assigment: PyBank and PyPoll. In each folder there are file called main.py. Inside of each there is main script that I created to run each analysis.
In both of these folders (PyBank and PyPoll) there are two folders: Resources and analysis. In Resources there are CVS files I used. Analysis folder contains text files that has the results from analysis I made.
